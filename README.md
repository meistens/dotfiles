Skeletio-izh file with logging and monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus for logging and metrics collection.

Checked blogs and used Claude - mostly for Grafana, their docs (if what they have can be called that) is so-so - to get started and speed things up.

Note: If the use of AI in any way whatsoever makes you rabid, now is a good time to not be involved with this repo, or me.
I like my codebase clean, and organized!
